For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

``` r
baltimore_homicides <- homicide_df %>%
  filter(city == "Baltimore", state == "MD")

# Use prop.test to estimate the proportion of unsolved homicides
unsolved_homicides <- sum(baltimore_homicides$disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"))
total_homicides <- nrow(baltimore_homicides)

prop_test_result <- prop.test(unsolved_homicides, total_homicides)

# Tidy the result of prop.test using broom::tidy
tidy_prop_test <- broom::tidy(prop_test_result)

# Pull the estimate and confidence intervals
tidy_estimate_ci <- tidy_prop_test %>%
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  pull()
```
