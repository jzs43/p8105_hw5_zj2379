## Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Create a city_state variable
homicide_df = read.csv("./homicide-data.csv")|>
 mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))


head(homicide_df, 100)

#summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides 
homicide_df |>
  group_by (city) |>
  summarize(total_homicides=n(),
            unsolved_homicides=sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest","Closed by arrest")))
```

 summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).
